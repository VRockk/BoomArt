Feedback:

	You have to wait for the blocks to fall for too long.

	You can return the bomb if you don't want to use it.

	You can't move the bomb if you place it under the building (on the ground).

	Explosion could be faster?

	Meter for how low do you have to get the building (how destroyed?)
	Player has no idea how the level is completed.

	level 7 physics fockd up.

Possible feature suggestions from testers:

	you can add a timer to the bomb by dragging your finger from next to the bomb and add a burning fuse?
	(the longer you drag it, the longer burning time you have)

	You could change the look of the detonator? (for example for special event bombs)

	You could swipe down the lever of the detonator yourself?
